# Iot_based_vehicle_accident-alert_system

OVERVIEW

In present days the rate of accidents can be increased rapidly. Due to employment the 
usage of vehicles like cars, bikes can be increased, because of this reason the accidents can be 
happened due to over speed. We often come across the fact that when an accident occurs the 
people nearby have to manually call the ambulance which leads to waste of time. Hence there 
is a delay for emergency services to arrive at the location of the accident. Proposed system 
makes an effort to provide the emergency facilities to the victims in the shortest time possible. 
It incorporates an embedded system that contains Accelerometer and GPS module is connected 
with an Arduino UNO.
In this project accelerometer is used to measure the vibration and tilt condition at the 
time of accident. Global Positioning System (GPS) is used to identify the location of the 
vehicle. When accident is occurred, the location details of vehicle/object collected by the GPS 
module from the satellite, this information is in the form of latitude and longitude scale. And then
inform the exact vehicular location to the concerned authority. There will be one push button 
if the person inside the car presses the button before 1 minute which means nothing is happened
to that person if he failed to press the button that means there is a serious accident and then 
alert message is sent to the concerned authority such as police station and ambulance via 
android application. The main purpose of this project is used to reduce the death ratio of a 
human and to provide the maximum assistance while accident occurs.

 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
Every day, hundreds of road accidents occur across the country. Road accidents occur 
for variety of reasons. Speeding is the most common cause of road accidents in the country. It 
is essential for motorists to be aware of the speed at which they’re travelling and stay within 
the legal limits. Now a day’s lots of road accidents happen on highways due to increase in 
traffic and also due to rash driving of drivers. And in many situations the ambulance and 
police authority is not informed in time. This result in delaying the help reached to the person 
suffered due to accident. Our project is designed to avoid such situation.

MOTIVATIONS

A large number of people deaths due to car accidents every day. There are some of 
reasons for which an accident can occur such as lack of training institute, use of mobile phone 
while driving the car, unskilled drivers, bad road condition, overloading and poor traffic 
management and in many situations the family members or the ambulance and police 
authorities not informed in time. There is a need of system to detect the road accident detection.
Our project car accident detection and alerting system with GPS is designed to avoid such 
situations. 

CHALLENGES

➢ Detecting accident forces without electronic control unit interaction is not possible
➢ It does not work without network.

 BENIFITS

➢ Faster Intimation to the right authority 
➢ Easy detection of accident
➢ Provide the solution for identifying the accident location

OBJECTIVES

➢ To find the vehicle where it is and locates the vehicle by means of sending a message 
using a system which is placed inside of vehicle system.
➢ Accelerometer detects the sudden change in the axes of vehicle.
➢ If accident takes place, quick transmission of message to concerned authority.
➢ Location of accident is sent in the form of Google Map link, derived from the latitude 
and longitude from GPS module.
