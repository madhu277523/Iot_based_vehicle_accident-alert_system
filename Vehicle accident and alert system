Now a days, nobody in this world is ready to look what’s happening around them. Even 
though, if any accident occurs no one cares about it. This is an intention to implement an 
innovative solution for this problem by developing a Vehicle Accident detection and Alerting 
System from the accident zone. With the growing population the use of vehicle as became 
superfluous and this has led to increase in the number of accidents at the alarm rate. The 
project Vehicle Accident Detection and Alerting System aims at detecting the vehicle accident 
and reporting the location of accident to the concerned authority through android application 
. This helps in a speedy service from the ambulance and the police station. In case of accident, 
if the vehicle is hit to some other vehicle or an object then there will be a push button inside 
the car. This push button should be used by the driver. If the accident is very normal, or driver 
has just hit the wall in some situations like parking then driver has to press the push button 
before 1 minute. This will inform the Arduino board that this is a very normal accident and 
then system will not send notification. But if driver is not in situation to press the push button 
or if the accident is really a major accident then driver will not press the button and then 
immediately alert message is sent with the exact location of accident to the concerned authority 
such as police station and ambulance. The GPS technology is used to locate the position of the 
vehicle and sends it through app. The main objective of vehicle accident detection and alerting 
system is to save person’s life.
